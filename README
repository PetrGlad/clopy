# clopy

Script that copies image and video files from digital camera memory card to computer.
I use it with Canon cameras on Ubuntu for other use cases it might need some tuning.

Now I have two cameras now I need to resolve more edge cases so this script 
is rewrite of pcopy (https://github.com/PetrGlad/pcopy) in Clojure.

## Usage

Not implemented yet.

TODO: write

clopy source-folder target-folder
where
* source-folder is where camera's memory card is mounted
* target-folder is root of your archive
